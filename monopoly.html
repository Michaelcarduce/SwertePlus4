        <p class="descriptions colorReg1 mb60">Monopoly Live is a very interesting and cheerful online variant of the Monopoly board game that has gained popularity among players from different countries. This game concept also offers a sustainable method of combining the normal game with the more often opening live games. Monopoly Live is another game developed by evolution gaming in the <span class="colorPri">live casino</span> simulation category of games. This game is as interesting as the others, it comes with bonus rounds and game features that will catch the attention of any user whether new or experienced.</p>
        
        <h2 class="heading2 colorSec mb20">About Monopoly Live</h2>
        <p class="descriptions colorReg1 mb20">Monopoly Live is a specialty online version of Monopoly, a board game focused around a large vertically designed wheel. The main objective of the game is simple: The actual performance is wherein a live host spins the wheel while the players have to place their bets on the segment where the wheel shall stop. This format is actually inspired partly by Dream Catcher, which is a well-known live game; however, the twists incorporated here are Monopoly-based and thus results in a different game from Dream Catcher.</p>

        <p class="descriptions colorReg1 mb60">There are numbers 1, 2, 5 and 10 that the players can stake and there are the special lines 2 ROLLS and 4 ROLLS which trigger the bonuses. There is yet another opportunity which is known as ‘CHANCE’ segments within the wheel in which the contestant can choose to accept cash rewards or multipliers. The virtual MR. MONOPOLY is featured in the game and they get anxious throughout waiting for whether they will form the winning segment or not.</p>
        
        <h2 class="heading2 colorSec mb20">How to Play Monopoly Live</h2>

        <p class="descriptions colorReg1 mb40">Monopoly Live is very friendly and would not require extensive learning especially from a first-time player. Players place bets on which segment they think the wheel will land on: 1, 2, 5, 10, ”2 ROLLS,” or ”4 ROLLS. ” When the wheel comes to a stop on a number selected by the player the punter is paid out in varying terms depending on the number; 1:1, 2:1 5:1, or 10:1.</p>
        <h3 class="heading3 colorTer">CHANCE Segments:</h3>
        <p class="descriptions colorReg1 mb20 plr100">Every time when the wheel stops on the “CHANCE” sector MR. MONOPOLY hands out a Chance card which reads either, “Collect a Cash Reward”, which grants a random amount of money, or a “2, 3, 4, 5 or 10 Times” which gives a multiplier bonus. As we have seen, in case of a multiplier bonus, all bets are to be kept spinning and the wheel is spun again. The resulting winnings get subjected to the multiplier that has been accorded to that round and other multipliers that are added for even a richer payoff.</p>
        <h3 class="heading3 colorTer">Bonus Rounds:</h3>
        <p class="descriptions colorReg1 mb60 plr100">To be able to get a chance of participating in the 3D Bonus Round, the players have to bet on either the “2 ROLLS” or the “4 ROLLS” part. When a wheel lands on these segments, it automatically lands on the Bonus game where players have the opportunity to join MR. MONOPOLY travels through imagination on an animated journey on a 3D MONOPOLY board game.</p>
        
        <h2 class="heading2 colorSec mb20">The 3D Bonus Round</h2>
        <p class="descriptions colorReg1 mb20">The feature that makes the Monopoly Live thrilling is the 3D Bonus Round that takes the qualifying players to an AR version of the Monopoly board. Players follow MR. MONOPOLY as he moves through the Monopoly board and claims the prizes, multipliers, and all the rest. Like in the normal Monopoly game, the movement from one square to the other depends on the throw of two dice. It is available only to the players who chose to bet on “2 ROLLS” or “4 ROLLS” buttons and gives the gamblers the opportunity to make the great win.</p>

The monetary squares are exciting as they offer multipliers as well as the regional extra bonuses and the chance to double up or even triple the game money.</p>
